### Java
During the summer of 2016, I had the amazing opportunity to intern at [ViaSat Inc.](https://www.viasat.com/){:target="_blank"}. I collaborated with another UCSB student to design, develop and test software made to automate the company software release pipeline in a continuous integration/development environment. The original process would take approximately four hours to release a new software build. With the tools we built, that process was reduced to mere minutes. The engineer would run our command line tool or GUI tool, fill out a small number of fields, and the tool would take care of the rest. The command line tools were made so it can easily be integrated into continuous integration/development software (such as Jenkins, Travis CI, etc.), so releasing software would not require any action from the engineer. The GUI was built with JavaFX.

### Python
[SpooderBot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=184537503284330496&scope=bot&permissions=133692435){:target="_blank"} is an asynchronous, multipurpose chat bot for the VoIP service [Discord](https://discordapp.com/){:target="_blank"}. It's built with Python 3.5 and implements several APIs to provide Discord members with music playing functionality (YouTube, Spotify) and image searches (GIPHY, Imgur). The bot also offers several administrative capabilities (point system, kicking/banning users, defining roles, etc) and debugging tools. Currently, SpooderBot is hosted on a inexpensive server running Ubuntu 16.04, used by two gaming communities with 50+ members, and its incredibly robust as it handles 20+ commands simultaneously with ease. 

### Sites
The following are some of the sites I've built over the years as an amateur web developer.

- [S.O. Plumbing Inc.](http://soplumbinginc.com/): Built with HTML, CSS, JS.
- [CodersSB](http://coderssb.com/): Built with Twig, HTML, CSS, JS. Managed with Grav CMS.
- [This Site](): First built using HTML, CSS, JS. Transitioned to self hosted Ghost blog. Now hosted on Github pages using Jekyll.
