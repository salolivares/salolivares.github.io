### Java
- <span class="as-link">ViaSat Inc.</span>: As an intern at ViaSat over the summer, I collaborated with another UCSB student to design, develop and test software made to automate the company software release pipeline in a continuous integration/development environment. The original process would involve an engineer taking approximately four hours to release a new software build. With the tools we built, that process was reduced to mere minutes. The engineer would run our command line tool or GUI tool, fill out a small number of fields, and the tool would take care of the rest. The command line tools were made so it can easily be integrated into continuous integration/development software (such as Jenkins, Travis CI, etc.), so releasing software would not require any action from the engineer. The GUI was built JavaFX following a model-view-controller software pattern.
