I've spent the past years just going through the motions and never reflecting on the past and never really setting clear goals for the future. This new year a decided to document how my year went and set goals. It was filled with my greatest accomplishments thus far, wonderful new experiences, and some of the lowest lows I've ever felt. Enjoy my unedited stream of consciousness.

### January
January was spent studying for interviews and interviewing. I didn't take it too seriously like my other peers but they motivated me enough to put some effort into interviewing. A friend referred me to ViaSat, a Carlsbad based communications company, and got through their interview process with an offer which I happily expected. Summer was going to be awesome.

### February
February was mostly spent studying for classes. The class I remember most from this Winter Quarter was Art History. Being exposed to something other that equations, algorithms, or programming was great breath of fresh air. For Valentine's Day I received a cool batch of programming related things (cookies, photo frame). I was taken aback on how effort was put into the gift. I'm not really good with gifts, especially thoughtful ones, thats something I can improve on, right?

### March - May
During this time some of my good friends and I signed a lease to live in IV, in a big two story house. I was pretty stoked considering how I lived alone 3rd year. The big downside though, it was probably the farthest you can get from the school. Oh well. On the academic side, CodersSB, a CS club I helped create at UCSB, started to get big and started to host more and more events.

Also, I finally got a car!! Well.. it was my sister's...

### June
June was probably the best month out of the whole year. I kicked it off by going to E3 Live with some good friends back in LA. We waited in lines to try out the HTC vives and try out VR for the first time. That experience was awesome, we got to play a puzzle game where all four of us had to work against the clock to beat a challenge. Great experience overall.

Also got to catch Finding Dora with the family, great movie and great to see a sequel to one of my favorite movies.

About two weeks into June, I moved to Carlsbad to begin my internship. I roomed with a good friend back from UCSB, and met tons of great people. My coworker and manager were great. I also got free access to the gym, and thus I started getting in shape for the first time ever. I also started cooking for myself, and basically stole my housemate's diet cause it was a) healthy b) easy to cook.


### July
July is where the pokemon go craze started kicking in. Even my manager joined in. We would spend some days hunting for pokemon on break.

Somewhere in between my internship, I went to Anime Expo. Always great to go to the Expo and see all the cool art and trinkets. Even though I'm not a big anime fan, it's a great event and you get tons of 3DS street passes :D.

I also explored San Diego with my then SO. We had some dope food and dessert and went to Balboa park, only to see the pokemon goers all over the place. We visited this beach (forgot it's name) that was great for snorkeling and we're disappointed we didn't bring a bathing suit.

Oh, and I went to HARD summer. Enough said.

### August
In August, I was still working hard at my internship. My coworker and I both managed to create awesome tools for the employees at ViaSat, which are hopefully actually used today.

Nearing the end of my internship ViaSat sent us to go see a Padres game. Front row seats and free food baby! (Although that's usually not the best angle to watch).

My siblings and I managed to surprise our mother for her birthday. It was very sweet :)

Towards the end of my ViaSat internship, I played Smash with my housemate and coworker. What an unforgettable experience. All Ganondorf, Hyrule Castle (bottom portion of the map).

Some good friends from back home also came up to visit me at my Carlsbad apartment. Great times. Food and Smash.

### September - October
With my internship concluding, it was back to school. I had moved into the new IV house, with 7 other people.

And with that the Fall quarter began. It would prove to be one of the most academically challenging and emotionally taxing quarters yet.

Sometime late October, my brother and I headed to the Staples Center to catch the League of Legends World championship. It seemed like it would be a repeat of the 2013 world championship, but the underdog team managed to bring the deficit back, resulting in a great set of games.

### November
This month was a great one. First, I was flown out for interviews in SF. Two other UCSB student were also flown out, one of being my good friend, and all three of us went out to catch a bite (I got 30 dollar worth of sushi. I was no where near finishing that). I got to stay at a dope hotel, too bad it was only for one night.

I also interviewed for Raytheon. Long story short, I'll be working there once a graduate. Yay! Job search over.

Towards the end of the month, I celebrated my birthday, and thanksgiving with amazing friends and family. Couldn't be happier.

For Thanksgiving break, I managed to catch Jai Wolf in LA. He was playing right next to Porter and still sold out! It was a great concert, and I discovered a new favorite artist of mine, [Jerry Folk](https://soundcloud.com/jerryfolkmusic/to-my-soul-jerry-folk-1).

This was also the beginning of the end...


### December
December, a bittersweet way to end the year.

For dead week, my partner and I were pulling 8-12 hours days trying to complete an assignment for class.

The worst thing possible happened before finals week. The loss of a loved one (no, not a death). I managed to pull through however. I just had to be a robot for most of that week, I was quite broken. But oh well, life moves on.

Once done with finals, I was back home, surrounded with family. The 4 week long break was well needed.

I gymed with a good friend, watched a the new Star Wars movie, and hung out with friends and family.

### 2016
Thank you to all my friends, new and old, for making this an amazing year.

Overall, a great year. 8/10.
