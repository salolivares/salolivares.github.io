### About

Hi, I'm <span class="as-link">Sal</span> and I'm a CS student at UCSB. I love learning about the bleeding edge developments in the programming (new frameworks, languages, and development tools) and in my free time develop new personal projects, maintain old ones, and do my best to stay fit.

I have extensive software development experience with <span class="as-link">Python</span> and <span class="as-link">Java</span>, and some web development experience with <span class="as-link">HTML</span>, <span class="as-link">CSS</span>, and <span class="as-link">JavaScript</span>. I also have experience configuring and administrating servers, and if it interests you at all, I'm fluent both in <span class="as-link">English</span> and <span class="as-link">Spanish</span>!

Some of the projects that I have worked on are highlighted below, for others check my resume or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/salolivares/){:target="_blank"}.
