Hi, I'm <span class="as-link">Sal</span> and I'm a CS student at UCSB. I love learning about the bleeding edge developments in the programming (new frameworks, languages, and development tools) and in my free time develop new personal projects, maintain old ones, and do my best to stay fit.

I have extensive software development experience with Python and Java, and some web development experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some of the projects that I have worked on are highlighted below, for others check my resume or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/salolivares/){:target="_blank"}. 

### Java
- <span class="as-link">ViaSat Inc.</span>: As an intern at ViaSat over the summer, I collaborated with another UCSB student to design, develop and test software made to automate the company software release pipeline in a continuous integration/development environment. The original process would involve an engineer taking approximately four hours to release a new software build. With the tools we built, that process was reduced to mere minutes. The engineer would run our command line tool or GUI tool, fill out a small number of fields, and the tool would take care of the rest. The command line tools were made so it can easily be integrated into continuous integration/development software (such as Jenkins, Travis CI, etc.), so releasing software would not require any action from the engineer. The GUI was built JavaFX following a model-view-controller software pattern.
